In this there are several easy and hard questions
 in Rust Programming Language.

Codes that are included in this repository are as:

1. Write a function to calculate the Median of a list of numbers
2. Write a function that filters duplicates within a list(vec<i32>)| (Find Unique Items)
3. W rite a function that can accept a String or a &str("string slice") | (Print any text type)
4. Write a function that sorts username, ignoring the case of any letters within them | (Case-insensitive sort)
5. Encode text as Morse Code | Convert text to Morse Code
6. Calculate the value of a hands of cards for the game of blackjack | (Value of a hand of Cards)
7. Create a function that can tell if an event's date has already Occured |(Has a deadline been reached?)
8. Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
9. Calculate the sum of list of numbers that contains missing value | Sum a list of number with missing value
10. Parse two strings as dates, then calculate the number of whole weeks between them |
    | Calculate the number of weeks between two dates
11. Verify that a string contains a valid ISBN Number | Validate an ISBN Number
12. Verify that a file actually exists on the file system and that you can write to it. | Check if a file exists
13. Parse a string that encodes a color and converts that to a Rust type | Interpret an RGB hex color
14. Encode and decode a string using run-length encoding | Run-length encoding
15. Create a function that can correctly parse multiple date formats |Handle Inconsistent dates
16. Find the shortest path between two points through a network | Travel Planner
    | Note: Implement any algorithm, but use the graph type defined within the sample code
    | Note: Speed Matters: Should be able to search a network with 10k nodes and 40k edges within 1s
    | you can use dijkstra's algorithm
17. Implement a vigenere cipher decoder | Find Challenge: Vigenere Cipher
    | Note: Implement vigenere:: decrypt function
    | Note : Decrypt the hidden message
